                <p> Hidden Potential started as a labor of love by a classroom teacher and behavior analyst
                    who wanted to focus on meeting the individual needs of each child and their family by
                    utilizing a combined knowledge of educational practices and ABA. After more than 15 years
                    in the education system and 13 years as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, our clinical director
                    has a unique perspective and diversified experience working with children with autism spectrum and
                    other developmental disabilities in various settings. Hidden Potential wants to create a plan to improve
                    the overall quality of your child’s life at home, in school, and as a part of their community. Let us help
                    you unlock the hidden potential inside your child!</p>
